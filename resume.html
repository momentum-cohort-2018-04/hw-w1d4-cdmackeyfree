            <h2>Experience</h2>

                <h3><a href="wwww.spoonflower.com">Spoonflower</a> Durham, NC</h3>
                <strong>Apprentice Software Developer</strong> – <em>December 2017 - Current</em>
                <p>As an apprentice developer I work directly with mentors on Spoonflower's Engineering department to complete 
                projects. I work mainly in Ruby on Rails and HTML as a backend developer in training.</p>

                Customer Service Advocate – November 2015 - December 2017
                As a customer service advocate, I was in direct contact with consumers getting user experience information
                on a daily basis. I provided troubleshooting solutions to technical issues ranging from use of the website 
                itself to design help. In this role I sharpend my abilities in Photoshop and other photo editing programs, 
                PowerPoint and Excel.</p>

                Operations – May 2014 - November 2015
                In the position of print operator allowed me the opportunity to work with Photoshop, Ergosoft and Kornit software 
                on a daily basis. As a printer I grasped the basics of troubleshooting server errors, issues with the tower 
                and various technical difficulties with the Allegro software.</p>

                <p>Self- Employed- Editor/Research Assistant/Writer/Website Consultant - January 2015 - November 2016
                I freelanced as a consultant to several business websites (including but not limited to <a href="http://mamas-hip.com/blog/">Mama’s Hip</a> and <a href="https://www.milkandbaby.com/blogs/">Milk & Baby</a>). 
                I provide technical support, editing, research services and contributed <a href="http://www.scarymommy.com/dont-have-to-be-martyr-to-be-mother/">guest pieces</a>. 
                Doing this has allowed me to further develop an eye for detail and precision, 
                while enhancing my (HTML and CSS) coding and troubleshooting skills.</p>
