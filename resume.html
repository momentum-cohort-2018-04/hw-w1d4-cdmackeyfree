            EXPERIENCE
            Spoonflower Durham, NC – Apprentice Software Developer – December 2017 - Current
            As an apprentice developer I work directly with mentors on Spoonflower's Engineering department to complete 
            projects. I work mainly in Ruby on Rails and HTML as a backend developer in training.

            Spoonflower Durham, NC – Customer Service Advocate – November 2015 - December 2017
            As a customer service advocate, I was in direct contact with consumers getting user experience information
            on a daily basis. I provided troubleshooting solutions to technical issues ranging from use of the website 
            itself to design help. In this role I sharpend my abilities in Photoshop and other photo editing programs, 
            PowerPoint and Excel. 

            Spoonflower Durham, NC – Operations – May 2014 - November 2015
            In the position of print operator allowed me the opportunity to work with Photoshop, Ergosoft and Kornit software 
            on a daily basis. As a printer I grasped the basics of troubleshooting server errors, issues with the tower 
            and various technical difficulties with the Allegro software. 

            Self- Employed- Editor/Research Assistant/Writer/Website Consultant - January 2015 - November 2016
            In my spare time, I freelance as a consultant to several business websites (including but not limited to Mama’s Hip and Milk&Baby). 
            I provide technical support, editing, research services and contributed guest pieces. 
            Doing this has allowed me to further develop an eye for detail and precision, 
            while enhancing my (HTML and CSS) coding and troubleshooting skills.
